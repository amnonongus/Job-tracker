**Collaboration**: Notion, LucidChart, AutoDraw, Slack, Zoom

## Next Steps

- Adjust Document Model to have a One-to-Many relationship with Users instead of Jobs so that users can upload their documents once and assign them to many different jobs
- Adding additional useful models to help with recruiter contacts and interview prep
- Implement Google Oauth or LinkedIn authorization to help streamline the job search
- Potentially implement additional APIs
- Add more fun responsive design changes for mobile and desktop views
- Add sort functionality for easy navigation of the job index
